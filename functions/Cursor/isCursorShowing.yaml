  description: |
    This function determines the state of a [player](/player)'s cursor.
  notes:
    - This function only handles the cursor state set by the [showCursor](/showCursor) function, ignoring it if the console, chatbox, or menu is opened.
    - If you use this function on the server-side, keep in mind that it only detects the [showCursor](/showCursor) function executed on the server-side and not changes done by client-side.
